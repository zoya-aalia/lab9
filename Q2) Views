       d.dname,
       COUNT(e.eno) AS totalEmp,
       SUM(e.salary) AS totalSalary
FROM dept d
LEFT JOIN emp e ON d.dno = e.dno
GROUP BY d.dno, d.dname;
SELECT * FROM deptSummary;



2) Write a CREATE VIEW statement for workson database called empSummary that has the employee number, name, salary, birthdate, department, count of projects worked on for the employee and the total hours worked. Only show employees in 'D1', 'D2', or 'D3' and with birthdate after '1966-06-08'

       COUNT(w.pno) AS totalProj,
       SUM(w.hours) AS totalHours
FROM emp e
LEFT JOIN workson w ON e.eno = w.eno
JOIN dept d ON e.dno = d.dno
WHERE e.dno IN ('D1', 'D2', 'D3') AND e.bdate > '1966-06-08'
GROUP BY e.eno, e.ename, e.salary, e.bdate, d.dname;
SELECT * FROM empSummary;
