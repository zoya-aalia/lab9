1) Write a trigger on MySQL with the workson data set (testing in your own database) that increases the budget of a project whenever a record is inserted in workson table. Increase the budget by $1,000.

CREATE TRIGGER increaseBudgetTrigger
AFTER INSERT ON workson
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN

DECLARE newProjBudget DECIMAL(9,2);

SELECT budget INTO newProjBudget
FROM proj
WHERE pno = NEW.pno;

SET newProjBudget = newProjBudget + 1000;

UPDATE proj
SET budget = newProjBudget
WHERE pno = NEW.pno;

END;


2) Write a trigger on MySQL with the workson data set (testing in your own database) that sets the salary of a new employee to be $5,000 more than the average salary of employees with that title whenever an employee is inserted with a salary less than $50,000. For example, if employee 'E10' called 'P. Person' with title 'ME' is inserted with a salary of $35,000, then the salary should be changed to $45,000 (average salary of 'ME' employees is $40,000)

CREATE TRIGGER salaryTrigger
BEFORE INSERT ON emp
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN

DECLARE avgSalary DECIMAL (9,2);

SELECT AVG(salary) INTO avgSalary
FROM emp
WHERE title = NEW.title;

IF NEW.salary < 50000 THEN
SET NEW.salary = avgSalary + 5000

END IF;
END;
